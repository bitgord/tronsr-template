## Current Server Configuration
Prior to June 27, we have launched 3 testable TRON nodes with AWS to allow for smooth transitioning into physical hardware after becoming a TRON Super Representative. We decided to host all three nodes in Central Canada to maintain a local presence of the TRON network infrastructure. 

#### Server 1 (Up and Running)
------------
AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
Server Location: Canada Central
Type: m4.4xlarge
CPUs: 16
Memory: 64GB
Storage: 250GB
Public IP: 35.183.28.96
 
#### Server 2 (Up and Running)
------------
AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
Server Location: Canada Central
Type: m4.4xlarge
CPUs: 16
Memory: 64GB
Storage: 250GB
Public IP: 35.182.125.179
 
#### Server 3 (Up and Running)
------------
AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
Server Location: Canada Central
Type: m4.4xlarge
CPUs: 16
Memory: 64GB
Storage: 250GB
Public IP: 35.183.23.5

## Future Server Configuration
Over the first few years after becoming a TRON Super Representative, we plan to add several additional nodes across North America and transition to hardware servers after the first year. We plan to upgrade the processor and memory as required by the network to ensure that the server stays below 70% capacity.
