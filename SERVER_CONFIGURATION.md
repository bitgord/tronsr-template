## Current Server Configuration
Prior to June 26, we have launched 3 testable TRON nodes with AWS to allow for smooth transitioning into physical hardware after becoming a TRON Super Representative. We decided to host all three nodes in Central Canada to maintain a local presence of the TRON network infrastructure. We will increase our capacity as is required to maintain the network. 

#### Server 1 (Up and Running)
------------
*AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
*Server Location: Canada Central
*Type: m4.4xlarge
*CPUs: 16
*Memory: 64GB
*Storage: 250GB
*Public IP: 35.183.28.96
 
#### Server 2 (Up and Running)
------------
*AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
*Server Location: Canada Central
*Type: m4.4xlarge
*CPUs: 16
*Memory: 64GB
*Storage: 250GB
*Public IP: 35.182.125.179
 
#### Server 3 (Up and Running)
------------
*AWS Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
*Server Location: Canada Central
*Type: m4.4xlarge
*CPUs: 16
*Memory: 64GB
*Storage: 250GB
*Public IP: 35.183.23.5

## Future Server Configuration
Over the first few months after becoming a TRON Super Representative, we plan to expand the number of nodes to up to 10 nodes in different parts of North America and transition to hardware servers after the first year or when it becomes necessary. All the nodes will have a similar configuration to what was mentioned above. We plan to upgrade the processor and memory as required by the network and to manually monitor the nodes to ensure that the server stays below 70% capacity. Being a super representative, we also have plans to setup our own hardware to maintain the nodes with the configuration below.
