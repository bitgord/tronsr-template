## Initial Funding
Prior to June 26 we far we have invested 10k into infrastructure and approximately 30k towards travelling to represent TRON at conferences, hosting meetups, buying hundreds of TRON shirts to giveout and airdropping TRON tokens. We have an additional reserve of capital reserved to develop the TRON community as a TRON Super Representative as is needed.
