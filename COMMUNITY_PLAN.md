Our team proposes a global integrated digital marketing, community management and educational campaign to develop the TRON communities across every region of the world and inspire the next generation of TRON entrepreneurs to develop decentralized applications using the TRON blockchain.

## Integrated Campaign

#### TRON Canada
Our team created the official TRON Canada Facebook Group that has grown to over 500 members before June 26. We will use this group to raise awareness for TRON and the initiatives that we are doing for TRON across Canada and partner with other event organizers that would add value to the TRON community. It will also be able to facilitate discussion between the Canadian TRON community.

#### Meetups/Conferences
Before June 26, our team has hosted meetups with TRON and we have represented TRON at conferences across the world including in [Toronto](https://www.facebook.com/MLGBlockchain/videos/1566842496736735/), Montreal, Vancouver, San Francisco, Ho Chi Minh, Sydney, Boston, Brampton, Miami, New York, Amsterdam, Bangkok, Quebec City, Delhi, Bangalore and Trivandrum. The goal of hosting these meetups and representing Tron at these conferences is to teach people about the disruptive potential of the Tron blockchain. This month we have two events planned in Toronto. The first one is Tuesday June 19 and will focus on educating the community about TRON and the second one is June 26 and will focus on discussing applications of TRON.

Being a TRON Super Representative would allow us to substantially increase the number of TRON meetups we host around the world.

#### Hackathons & Developer Training: 
We hosted BlockHacks, a blockchain hackathon that TRON was featured at with 100 McGill and Concordia University students, two of the top universities in Canada, and other community partners including some of the most active fintech venture firms. The goal of the hackathon was to challenge students aspiring to be blockchain developers with making disruptive applications on new blockchain fabrics, including TRON, in a 48 hour period.

In addition to hosting more blockchain hackathons, we plan as a TRON Super Representative to host TRON blockchain development workshops to teach blockchain developers how to build applications with TRX and on the TRON blockchain. We will also publish TRON blockchain development tutorials on a new page of our website that will be focused entirely on TRON research and development.

#### Competitions
We have seen immense success by challenging the TRON community with giveaways, such as the TRON trading challenges which substantially increased the global trading volume of TRX. As a TRON Super Representative, we will take the industry best standards and build on them to create engaging competitions with a referral feature to create a viral effect for engagement with the TRON community.

#### Airdrops
We have introduced hundreds of people around the world to their first TRON at airdrop events we have hosted and participated in. We partner with meetup organizers of blockchain communities around them the world and provide them with a way to give a small amount of TRON tokens to a targeted grassroots community in key regions to kickstart the growth of the new community.

#### Social Media
Our team has been posting news about TRON across our channels since TRON was launched. In addition, we create original designs for TRON and video recaps of our team representing TRON at events such as this one from a conference in [Toronto](https://www.facebook.com/MLGBlockchain/videos/1566842496736735/).

## Resources

#### Dedicated Staff
MLG Blockchain has full time staff who are dedicated to expanding the TRON movement around the world. Being a TRON SR would allow us to devote substantially more resources to developing the global community for TRON, building dApps on the TRON blockchain and teaching others how to build on TRON themselves. 

#### Proprietary Email List
We can use our proprietary email databases with over 50k blockchain enthusiasts and over 5k investors to drive traffic to the meetups and other initiatives that we are hosting. We can also use our in-house PR and media partners to raise awareness for the events in blockchain publications and event directories, make sure to get quality content to share afterwards and show the world know how active the global TRON community is.

#### TRON Developer Resources
Being a TRON Super Representative, we will create a focused section of our website for TRON developer resources, including tutorials on how users can build nodes and interact with them, setup and use wallets, vote for community initiatives such as the SR, and build different types of decentralized applications.

We will also continue to create more forums for the TRON community and provide support with moderation to interact, answer questions and help new members of the TRON community understand the value proposition of TRON and ultimately learn how to build on the TRON blockchain.
